This project aims to explore the relationship between the United States stock market,
the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), as well as the US Census Bureau of Economic Indicators (US-CBEI)
by using data analysis, visualization and machine learning.

Once this project is completed it will produce both an analytics report (PDF) with the results of the study 
and an interactive dashboard by using DASH and Plotly. There is currently no ETA since this is a self-study project,
and I am not a programmer or data analyst - I just know how to use the Google Search engine.
